# CSS calc() function unexpected results
This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function: unexpected results due to inconsistent unit usage or operator precedence problems.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.

The problem arises from the inconsistent use of units within the `calc()` function.  Correct unit usage ensures accurate calculations and avoids unexpected rendering issues.
